# JSudokuSolver
Sudoku solver in java, with input from image and digit recognition. Preparation for Android App

I plan to make an App for Android which loads a sudoku game from camera, interpretes with hough transform and neural network,
then solves the puzzle. This project is a preparation which offers the implementation in Java on desktop. Although there are
already similar Apps, it is just for fun and reviewing Java.

Currently neural network for digit recognition(trained with mnist dataset) and simple sudoku solver are done. Next steps are IO
of network framework and transform of game board. If everything works fine, these classes would be added into an Android 
App.

In case some one drops by and gets interested, just download to workspace and create a project with same name in Eclipse.
